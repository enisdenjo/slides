# What is Federated GraphQL?

Allows multiple services (subgraphs) to work together to present a single, unified GraphQL API

**Management**

Each service manages its own part of the schema (e.g., users, products) while still contributing to the overall API.

**API**

Clients interact with one endpoint, but queries are resolved across multiple services.

**Relationships**

Services can reference fields and types from other services, enabling complex, multi-service queries.

**Coordination**

A GraphQL Gateway compiles and delegates queries to the appropriate services, ensuring seamless execution.

<!--
- Let's start by saying that a federated GraphQL connects multiple services to work together to present an unified GraphQL API

- This allows for a few interesting things

# What is Federated GraphQL?

Why Federation Matters

- Service Independence
- Improved Scalability
- Faster Iteration

<!--
- Each team or service can evolve its part of the schema without requiring coordination across the entire organization.
- By splitting the schema into smaller, independently managed services, organizations can scale individual parts of the API without burdening the entire system.
- Teams working on different services can deploy changes to their subgraph independently, allowing for faster iterations and releases.
